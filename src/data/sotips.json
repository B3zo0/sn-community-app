To do so, go to your profile (by clicking your username on top) and then  click on the prefs tab present just before the accounts tab. There you can add your interesting and ignored tags; for example the interesting tags are those you are good at like it can be php, mysql, java, etc. Add as many as you think. Similarly, you also need to add Ignored tags; doing this will remove all questions from SO homepage that are not as per your expertise and this will also increase your chances of answering a question before anyone else does."

If you have answered it correctly and are the first to answer then if anyone else visits that question, he may vote you up rather than providing his own correct answer that you have already provided.\n\nBy default, all answers are ordered by number of votes, so if you manage to get some votes, your answer will be on top of all there by having more chances of getting votes and finally chosen as the final correct answer something for which you earn 15 additional points.\n\nGetting your answer (correct one) to be first just makes it more likely to get quick votes but remember this is not the rule of thumb, an answer posted after even half an hour can be voted up and chosen as the final correct answer. Another important thing is that once you have posted your answer, you can revise it, add more details such as lists, images, etc. This shows how comprehensive answer you have given with examples/demos and makes your answer best in the queue."

The downside here is that the low-churn tags are also more likely (by volume) to be from new posters who don't know what the accept button is, or don't even have the rep to upvote. However, those few regular contributors to those tags will likely hit you with an upvote when they see your answer."

Using an online compiler is helpful. Grammar Correction: Some people (most commonly new users) will post bad grammar. Edit that as soon as possible so that the question is good quality. Grave Accents: Names of methods should use grave accents to open and close. Block quotes: use the > followed by any text to block quote the entire line. This is generally used for errors. Titles: Sometimes the title contains unnecessary words (ie. C# in a question that is tagged C#). Delete those. For unclear titles, they can be fixed."
